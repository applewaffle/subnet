# subnet
A simple command line subnet calculator written in C. This program was primarily written to explore binary logic.

Compile with "gcc ./subnet.c"

Run with "./a.out <IP Address> <Subnet Mask>" or "./a.out <IP Address> <CIDR>"

Any invalid entry runs the help function. The program doesn't do much input validation at present.
